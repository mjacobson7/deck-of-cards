# Deck Of Cards - Find the Queens

This is a simple node app that uses the [Deck of Cards API](http://deckofcardsapi.com/) to randomly draw two cards at a time, sort them by suit, and stop drawing once a queen has been drawn for each suit.  Once the queens are found, it will then sort the cards in each suit array from lowest to highest
